          <li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating webpages</li>
          <li>The head elements contains information about the webpage, such as the language it is written in</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>While the head content is not shown to users, it contains metadata that helps the browser render the page correctly</li>
          <li>You must use an opening tag and a closing tag to define each element </li>
          <li>The style ement defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, key words, author, and viewport</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser</li>

          <li>Cascading Style Sheets is a programming language used to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A class attribute allows us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>

          <li>The git command must precede every git statement</li>
          <li>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>
          <li>A pull request is used to merge a comparison branch into the main branch.</li>
          <li>A branch is a copy or version of the code that can be worked on independently in isolation so development changes do not disrupt other team members who are also working on the code and testing their solutions.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main pulls down any changes from the base branch</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop requires three statements to work: a starting point, a condition, and an iteration</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. It is used to define and reuse blocks of code.</li>
